# Reinforced FDM: 
## Multi-Axis Filament Alignment with Controlled Anisotropic Strength

Updatedï¼š July-02-2021

This is the code to slice curved 3D printing layer and generate toolpath based on the stress distribution. The generated toolpath can be printed by multi-axis 3D printer, which results a higher strength in fabricated model.
