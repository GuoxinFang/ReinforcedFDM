This is the code to slice curved 3D printing layer and generate toolpath based on the stress distribution. The generated toolpath can be printed by multi-axis 3D printer, which results a higher strength in fabricated model.

## Installation

Please compline the code with QMake file 'ReinforcedFDM.pro'.

Tested platform: 

MacOS: QT Creator 

**Windows (recommand)**: Visual Studio + QT-plugin (tested QT version: 5.12.10 + msvc2017_64)

**Remark**: if you are using Visual Studio, after using QT VS Tool to open the .pro file and generate the project,

- **Set 'shapeLab' as the start up project**

- **Enable OpenMP to get best performace** at: ShapeLab Project Property -> 'Configuration Proerties' -> c/c++ -> Language -> Open MP Support -> Select 'Yes (/openmp)'

- **Open Console** at: ShapeLab Project Property -> 'Configuration Proerties' -> Linker -> System -> Select 'Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)' in 'SubSystem'

## Usage

**First input tetrahedral mesh into the system.**

Two sample models are given 'Bunnyhead.tet' and 'topopt_new.tet'. You can either drag the file into the blank area of the UI or open the panel "file -> open" and then select the model.

**Step 1: Input FEA simulation result** and compute principle stress direction as vector field by clicking bottom 'Step 1: Input FEA Result'.

- The color map on the mesh visulize the stress distribution. You can draw the stress vector field by using function "View -> Profile" or direct click the "Profile" bottom.

- You can also change the percentage of the critical region by changing the value below 'Step 1: Input FEA Result' bottom and click 'Change ratio' to redraw the field. Notice the parameter used in our paper is already set as the initial value in UI.

**Step 2: Compute Field** (for both vector field and scalar field) by clicking bottom 'Step 2: Field Computing'. This process may take some time to compute the optimized field.

- After finish computing the field, you can draw the scalar field at by using function "View -> Node" or direct click the "Node" bottom.

- The vector field can be draw by using function "View -> Profile" or direct click the "Profile" bottom. (the perivious stress field will be replaced).

**Step 3: Slicing the model and generate curved layer** by clicking bottom 'Step 3: Curved Layer Slicer'. You can change the Layer # with different value on the right side.

- You will then have the curved layer in the UI. You can check each layer in "Visual" panel by choosing differnt layer number or only draw single layer by click 'Draw Single'.

**Step 4: Compute vector field on each curved surface (for toolpath generation)** by clicking ' Step 4: Compute Field on Iso-Surface'.

- **Caution:** Before run this process, please make sure you disable the drawing of profile, otherwise the system will automatic draw the vector field on every layer (may take 1 min to draw this)!

**Step 5: Split and output generated curved surface** by clicking ' Step 5: Output Layer Below'. The curved surface will be installed at folder "./model/IsoSurface/ModelName/"

- This function will also split the surface into single piece. For example, if one layer (No. 10) contains three region, our code will output three .obj file named as 1000.obj, 1001.obj and 1002.obj. 
You can output the entire surface without split by decelect the checkbox 'split', however this will bring error to the final toolpath generation.

**Step 6: Toolpath Generation** by clicking 'Step 6: Multi-toolpath Generation (New)'.

- This process will take quiet long time as each layer will be first load into the system, compute scalar field & boundary distance field, and substract the hybird stress-aligned curved toolpath.
Please make sure you enable OpenMP to accelerate the computing process. Normally it takes **2-3 mins** to run the top-opt model on a 6-Core Intel CPU.
By opening the Console you can also check the progress during the computing.

- This process will also take more than 8GB memory on your PC for the top-opt model, please make sure you have at least 16GB RAM to get best performance.

- After finish computing the toolpath, please enable drawing the toolpath by using function "View -> Edge" or direct click the "Edge" bottom.
you will also see all the toolpath as a mesh visulized in 'Model tree' panel. In 'Visual' panel, you can click the bottom "Deselect all in model tree" and then select the layer you want to draw by click it in Model tree.

- Generated toolpath will be output in folder "./model/IsoSurface/'your-model-name'/toolpath/" as txt file. The toolpath is represneted as waypoints in format "x,y,z,nx,ny,nz".

## Fabrication Enabling

- The code for fabrication enabling part in our work is still under construction ......
